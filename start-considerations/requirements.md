# Requirements for the transit planner app

## Functional requirements - user stories

As the app user, I want to be able to:

1. Find a public transit connection between two stops, so that i can travel easily.
2. Set my transfer times to more/less aggressive, so that when I'm carrying heavy bags, I can take my time and when I don't have much time, I can run at transfers.
3. Set balance between shortest time and least transfers, so that if I'm in a hurry, I can choose to take a faster route with more transfers and if I have heavy bags, I can choose the slower routes with least transfers.
4. Set my own walking speed, so that the app uses it to calculate the exact time it will take me to do the transfers/walking parts.
5. Set my own cycling speeds, so that the app calculates the correct time for my cycling segments.
6. Manually set the transfer time at certain stations, so that the app knows, how long it takes me to transfer there and calculates the connections accordingly.
7. Set my current walking reluctance value, so that I can tell the app how much I currently am willing to walk - i.e. if it's raining/I have to carry heavy stuff, I probably want to walk as little as possible and vice versa.
8. See connections from/to multiple near stops, so that I can decide to take a connection from other stop than the one I searched from, if the connection there is better.
9. See the departure times exactly in seconds, instead of whole minutes, so that I can see how much i need to hurry, for example in the metro.
10. Search for connections including using shared bikes, if I currently want to, so that I don't have to use multiple different apps to use both public transit and shared bike services.
11. Select the connection I'm taking and be notified, if anything important changes during my travel, so that I'm aware, if one of my connections is delayed too much for the selected transfer, or vice versa.


## System/Qualitative requirements

1. the app should be using as little mobile data as possible
2. The search should be quick, so that the user doesn't have to wait for the result for too long.
